# Scaffold

The modules and code located within the `@Scaffold` module namespace and folder
structure are responsible for generating seagull class files in a structured
way.
There are plain "generators" for the individual files as well as skelettons for
organized units of files, which apply multiple generators in one well-defined
step.
