# Seagull.js

A lightweight, isomorphic, universal, fullstack, opinionated and experimental
web framework. The goal is to create an CoC abstraction layer with maximum
convenience over the combination of a serverless backend architecture and a
modern frontend SPA framework (vue.js), batteries included.
