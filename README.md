# Work in Progress, DO NOT USE

# Seagull.js

A lightweight, isomorphic, universal, fullstack, opinionated and experimental
web framework. The goal is to create an CoC abstraction layer with maximum
convenience over the combination of a serverless backend architecture and a
modern frontend SPA framework, batteries included. Should also solve Javascript
Fatigue by providing a zero-configuration developer experience.

## Roadmap / Milestones:

- [x] design basic framework structure
- [x] set up typescript / tooling
- [x] set up testing framework
- [x] implement classic server logic as abstract lambda api handlers
- [ ] implement data storage as abstract dynamodb models
- [ ] choose the ideal frontend framework (vue, moon, ...) and include it

This is the framework core, and not meant to be used standalone for now. There
is an official CLI tool in the works (seagull-cli), which will do the heavy
lifting.

The framework itself just needs a basic functionality working for the CLI to be
implemented.
