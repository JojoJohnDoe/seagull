## Guides

- [Folder Structure](folder-structure) for Seagull Apps

## Concepts

Seagull aims to solve the major pain points developer currently face when
building web apps. Therefore the subtitle of the framework is not a joke,
these Buzzwords mean the following:

- **[Featherweight](featherweight)**:
  Ambitiious frameworks tend to become heavy, bloated and too big to grasp in a
  hurry. Seagull aims to be a great choice for the fast paced environment of
  Hackathons or Startups, while also flying in circles around complex enterprise
  solutions when it comes to performance and scalability.

- **[Zero-Config](zero_config)**:
  From start to deployment: there is no need to set up dozens of dependencies,
  build tools or cherry-picking libraries. In the spirit of "Convention over
  Configuration (CoC)", Seagull manages everything for you transparently.

- **[Typesafe](typesafe)**:
  Seagull leverages the most popular web programming language out there
  (Javascript), but goes huge steps forward by embracing modern Typescript.
  Everything is checked at compile time, *including* your frontend.

- **[Isomorphic](isomorphic)**:
  Your whole app is written in the same language: Typescript. The backend
  parts will be executed through node.js, the frontend consists of
  react-like components, including styles-in-js code, the database is
  a NoSQL document store that deals with JSON. Fullstack on steroids.
  [&rarr; more...](isomorphic)

- **[Cloud](cloud)**:
  The framework is optimized to compile apps to AWS Lambda functions and spin up
  a serverless infrastructure via AWS Cloudformation. There are no servers to
  manage anymore, you only pay for what you use. Small Projects (~10,000
  requests per day) are within AWS *free* tiers.

- **[Framework](framework)**:
  A modern *fullstack* web application consists of an interactive
  single-page-application (SPA), with server-side-rendering (SSR) for
  initial page loads and crawlers, plus server-only data processing stuff.
  Seagull provides all of that, out of the box.

Seagull was [inspired by many other trends](inspirations) in web development and
represents the idea of combining the very latest advancements in web development
technologies in frontend and backend with the
[philosophy of ruby and rails](http://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/). While the era
of Ruby and Rails is coming to an end currently, Seagull aims to preserve the
mindset for future generations. A big leap in the technological foundations,
bypassing stepping stones like Go, Elixir, Phoenix, Crystal, Ember.js and
others, going straight to the true cloud computing era. This futuristic world
just needs a bit of spirit from a more civilized age, like the mindset of
focussing on developer happiness for real boosts in productivity.
