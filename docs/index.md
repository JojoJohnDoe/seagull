## Introduction

This is the documentation for the framework core. Not to be confused with
the corresponding [CLI tool](https://github.com/seagull-js/seagull-cli).

Just start digging [here](doc/) if you want. :)

## Why the name?

Seagulls are my favorite animals. They can fly in the sky (-> cloud deployment),
dive into the seas (-> todo) and walk on land (-> todo).
